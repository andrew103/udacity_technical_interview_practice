=============================== QUESTION_1 ====================================
I decided to employ the method of popping characters out of lists of each
string since it felt like one of the more straightforward solutions to this
problem. I based this off the concept that an anagram of a word is formed by
using the letters within the original word and doesn't necessarily need to
follow the order of the letters in the original word. Given this idea, I
figured that if I go through each string and pop out the matches till either
there's not a match or all the letters in the anagram list have been popped.
In doing this, I not only find if the string is an anagram, but I also account
for duplicates in letters based on the rule that each letter can only be used
once. With this configuration, the runtime is O(n*m) since you're looping through
one string within the loop of the other. The memory efficiency is also O(n*m)
since you're working within two lists of the string elements.

=============================== QUESTION_2 ====================================
I feel that the way in which I solved this problem is one of the more space
efficient methods available, although maybe not the most time efficient. It
felt easy and simple enough to go through the string once and find all the
palindromes in that one run. This way, the space efficiency is limited to O(n),
based on the number of palindromes in the string after searching. With a little
more work however, it could be reduced to O(1) space efficiency. The time
efficiency is O(a*n*m). "n" is representative of the length of the string and
the process of iterating through it. "m" represents looping through a section
of the string to extract a palindrome. "a" represents looping through the
palindromes found to find the longest. With some added work, this could also be
reduced to O(n*m) efficiency.

=============================== QUESTION_3 ====================================
For this problem, I employed the concept of Kruskal's algorithm. Although not
following it exactly, I implemented a similar form that is easier to
visualize in my mind at least despite being longer than other programs that use
Kruskal's algorithm. Time efficiency for this problem is O(n*m) since in the
main program's loop, there is a call to a helper function that contains a loop.
The space efficiency for this program would be O(n) since at any one time, a
list or a number of separate lists of n components exist.

=============================== QUESTION_4 ====================================
Since building a tree using Node objects makes traversing and evaluating their
position and children easier, I implemented that approach. In this way, I could
easily go through and establish checks for my nodes. Also, by starting my
search from the root node and making my way down, the time efficiency of the
actual searching part of the program becomes O(log(n)). However, with the
helper functions in place, the time efficiency becomes O(n*m) since one of them
uses a loop within another loop for creating the tree given a matrix. The space
efficiency of the program would be O(n) since only a series of lists are being
produced.

=============================== QUESTION_5 ====================================
I chose this approach to solving the problem since when the linked list is
redrawn into an ordered list consisting of only the data entries, it becomes
much easier to then identify a value provided an index (such as mth number from
the end). The time efficiency of this program is O(n) since it only loops
through the linked list nodes. The space efficiency is O(1) since the program
is simply iterating through a list.
